In this instruction, the terms \u201cDoD awards\u201d and\n\u201cDoD decorations\u201d are synonymous and refer to the following awards:  Defense\nDistinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Joint Service Commendation Medal, Joint Service Achievement Medal, Joint Meritorious Unit Award, and Humanitarian Service\nMedal.\n\nJoint.  For eligibility for DoD decorations, the term \u201cjoint\u201d connotes activities,\noperations, or organizations in which elements of more than one Service, as reflected in the Joint Table of Distribution, Joint Manning Document, or Joint\nTable of Mobilization Distribution, perform joint missions under the auspices of the CJCS or the commander of a unified command.  Support elements of such organizations composed of one Service are not considered elements of a joint organization nor are they eligible for DoD decorations.\n\nMeritorious Service.  Meritorious service is individual performance of duty\nexceeding that expected by virtue of grade and experience, based on accomplishments during an entire tour of duty.  Meritorious service tour\nperiods normally meet or exceed one year.\n\nOutstanding Achievement.  An outstanding achievement is a single, specific act\nor accomplishment, such as a special project, that is separate and distinct from regularly assigned duties.  An outstanding achievement award is not\nintended to provide a means to authorize additional decorations or a decoration when the conditions for a completed period of service have not been fulfilled.  An outstanding achievement award normally covers a short period with definite\nbeginning and ending dates.  A recommendation for an outstanding\nachievement award should be submitted only when the achievement is of such magnitude that it cannot be recognized in any other way than by award or decoration and when delaying such recognition until completion of the individual\u2019s period of service would diminish the significance of the\naccomplishment.  Impact time periods are under one year.\n",
